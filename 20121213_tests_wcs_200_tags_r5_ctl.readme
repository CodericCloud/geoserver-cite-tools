Patch for WCS 2.0 test suite
============================

Most of the changes are:

Replacing
   <ctl:header name="Content-type">application/x-www-form-urlencoded</ctl:header>
with
   <ctl:header name="Content-type">application/xml</ctl:header>
in XML POST requests.

Replacing 
   <ctlp:schema type="resource">wcs/2.0/wcsDescribeCoverage.xsd</ctlp:schema>
(or other fixed response schemas) with
   <ctlp:schema type="resource">wcs/2.0/wcsAll.xsd</ctlp:schema>
where an ows:ExceptionReport was expected.

In req18 replaced the SERVICES param into SERVICE, both in XML and KVP requests, 
since that test should check requests on non existent coverage names.
